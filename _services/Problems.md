Everyone generates digital traces on a set of systems. These traces are used in criminal investigations and can be used to convince or innocent a person; it is a waste we can do more with those data.

We want these systems to work for the users. They can certify attributes like places, time, proximity, all based on the already available data. Certification providers don't need to share the actual data or logs.

Those logs are unexploited data mines [1]. They can create trusted data and reduce the costs of securing enterprises that need it to deliver their services.

[^ 1]: Except in serious criminal investigations.

## IT security is a failure

The most common approach to secure an IT system is based on the lack of involvement and confidence in users and applications. Safety is ensured a posteriori, by the network and for those who pay it, summarized large companies, states, and very regulated environments. Secure solutions from the design exist, of course but it's marginalized.

The result is that it is always more complex and more expensive to secure because it is an externality to the initial business. The security cost only increased, but the protection remains pretty stable. Premium customers or those providing the service (insurers, for example) must cover the security for everyone.

## Marketing and Freemium

The Freemium / Premium approach economically imposes advertising revenues and a large share of freemium. It is financially almost impossible to propose fundamental protection of data use. The number of users not paying is that nature dictates the standard product.
Privacy offers are almost always false promises.

## Mandatory espionage

An enterprise has a crucial need to ensure the legitimacy of the data sent to them. Technically, he more data on a user, the safer, but users feel spied. The circle is vicious; honest users will try to escape monitoring, and become more expensive due to increased complexity. Digitization was initially intended to reduce processing costs.

## Loss of confidence, terms & conditions

The scandals of massive data flights are weekly. The terms and conditions of online services are rarely understood, almost impossible to refuse. Users feel obliged to sign, hence surprised when some agreed policies are applied.

The market is maturing on those privacy issues. Cons consumers and professionals for technological support in their uses so as not to be alone in front of a GAFA, banks, great enterprise and feel obliged to accept the terms and conditions of use.
In summary, we are convinced that a path between anonymity and zero privacy is possible and desirable.

## The false digitization

We see examples of "digitization" every day where the PDF file replaces the paper. This way of doing things only leads to physical displacement gain. Security or confidence is at best equal to paper and signatures.
There is a large margin and many cases that will benefit from our approach.
