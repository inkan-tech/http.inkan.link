# Trust in multi-factor certifications

Inkan is a Japanese word for the seal as an object. It represents our approach to generate verifiable and fully private data then use it on behalf of the data owner for direct digitally based services.

By analogy, we aim to become the Paypal of digital proofs, allowing services and settlements to be frictionless, automated, and verifiable.

It solves a trust crisis with technology providers by having Inkan technology expertise on the customer's side.
